# Required Information when Submitting Tank Game

## Version of Java Used:
Java 16
## IDE used: 
InteliJ IDEA 2021.1.2 Ultimate Edition

## Steps to Import project into IDE and ## Steps to Build your Project:
In order to import this tank game project as a JAR file, first go into project structure and select artifacts. We add the out directory that we want to make a JAR which should just show the project you have open and the main class that’s running the game, after selecting hit apply and OK. After that we could and build artifacts with it inside the out folder. It’ll produce a JAR file zip that could be moved into another folder and open the game by right clicking to open and run without needing to build through the compiler.

 
## Steps to run your Project:
The project runs when you click run after building the project to make sure it compiles properly with no errors. Once you’re able to compile with no issues, you could run the main program and that will start the tank game. The process should look like this:
Run Intellij 
IntelliJ : File -> New -> Project from Existing Sources -> Browse to the project folder and open all -> tankgame . To make the game run, you must run TRE class.

JAR : jar -> csc413-tankgame-k-harvey.jar -> right click -> Run
